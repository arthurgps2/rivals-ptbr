3021 = "If you are holding left or right when you press the dodge button, you will roll instead of parrying."

3042 = "Now let's try strong attacks."
3043 = "If you press the strong button while on the ground, you will perform a strong attack. The type of strong attack you perform depends on the direction you hold."
3044 = "-Forward strong (FSTRONG): hold sideways or neutral and press strong.\n-Up strong (USTRONG): hold upward and press strong.\n-Down strong (DSTRONG): hold downward and press strong."
3045 = "If you hold down the strong button, you can charge your strong attack to increase its power. (With default controls, you can also hold the right stick to perform charged strong attacks.)"

//---- INTERMEDIATE MOVEMENT TUTORIAL
3062 = "Welcome to the intermediate movement tutorial! In this tutorial, you'll learn some of the more technical ways to move around."
3063 = "First up is the short hop."
3064 = "A short hop is exactly what it sounds like: a smaller version of your normal jump."
3065 = "To do a short hop, just tap the jump button briefly."
3066 = "If you hold the jump button for more than 5 frames, you will do a full hop instead of a short hop, so you must be quick. (Note: these 5 frames are called jumpsquat.)"
3067 = "Try short hopping over my projectiles 3 times in a row."
3068 = "Short hops are great for minimizing the time you're in the air so you can reach the ground faster, which allows you to extend your combos even further."
3069 = "Another way to land quickly is to fastfall, which gives you an instant downward boost."
3070 = "To perform a fastfall, quickly press the control stick downward while you are falling."
3071 = "You cannot fastfall if you are moving upward, so make sure you time the fastfall after the peak of your jump."
3072 = "Try jumping in front of me and then using fastfall to avoid my attack 3 times in a row."
3073 = "Sometimes a successful recovery requires more than your regular jumps, and that's where wall jumping comes in."
3074 = "Performing a walljump is simple: Once you're in the air, hold the control stick toward the wall and press the jump button."
3075 = "You can only walljump once until you touch the ground or get hit."
3076 = "Try reaching that platform with a walljump. Sorry, but I've temporarily disabled your double jump."
3077 = "You can also walljump while in the special fall." //***updated
3078 = "Try reaching the platform, this time using only USPECIALs and walljumps.\n(Note: Zetterburn's USPECIAL travels in the direction of the control stick.)"
3079 = "Fantastic!"
3080 = "These wall jump techniques will help your recovery immensely when you're sent offstage. Make sure you practice all of these techniques so you can use them anytime you need them."

//---- INTERMEDIATE DEFENSE TUTORIAL
3081 = "Welcome to the intermediate defense tutorial! Here you will learn about directional influence and teching. Correct use of these techniques is vital to your survival, so pay attention."
3082 = "Let's start with Directional Influence, which is often shortened to DI."
3083 = "DI is the ability to change the angle at which you travel when launched by the enemy. To DI an attack, simply hold a direction on your control stick when you're hit."
3084 = "If I were to hit you with an attack that naturally sends in this direction..."
3085 = "And you were to hold your control stick in this direction..."
3086 = "You would be sent flying in this new direction."
3087 = "By holding the control stick perpendicular to the original knockback angle, you can change the trajectory angle by up to 18 degrees!"
3088 = "Remember, DI can only change the angle at which you are hit, not how hard you are hit."
3089 = "Let's try it out. Move your control stick around to test the effects of DI."
3090 = "Notice how holding the control stick parallel to the knockback angle has the same effect as no DI at all."
3091 = "There are two ways to apply DI:\n  1. Surviving strong attacks (Survival DI)\n  2. Escaping combos (Combo DI)"
3092 = "Lesson 1 will be on Survival DI."
3093 = "This dotted line represents the blastzone.\nIf you pass the blastzone, you lose one stock."
3094 = "If you're hit by a strong attack that sends you flying in this direction, you will certainly pass the blastzone if you don't DI."
3095 = "If you DI this hit downward, you will die even earlier."
3096 = "If you DI upward, however, you will survive the attack! Notice how the arrow never crosses the dotted line."
3097 = "Let's try it out! Use good DI to survive my attack 3 times in a row."
3098 = "Very nice! Once you implement this into your play style, your stocks will last a lot longer."
3099 = "Now..."
3100 = "Let's learn how to use DI to escape from combos."
3101 = "Many combo moves send you at an angle similar to this one."
3102 = "If you hold inward, the opponent will be able to easily follow up with another attack."
3103 = "If you hold outward, however, the opponent will have to move a lot farther to hit you again."
3104 = "Try using DI to escape my combo 3 times in a row. Just try to touch the ground before going offstage."
3105 = "Those are the basics of DI. With some attacks, applying DI isn't as simple as what you just learned. But with practice, DI will help you out in most bad situations."
3106 = "Let's move on to teching."
3107 = "You see, touching the ground while in hitstun will put you in a helpless state for a short time. If you are hit downward hard enough, it can even bounce you off the ground."
3108 = "To avoid these bad situations, you must tech!"
3109 = "If you press the dodge button right before touching the ground, you will perform a tech."
3110 = "Teching makes you briefly invincible, but your opponent can punish you if they predict the tech."
3111 = "If you hold left or right when teching, you will perform a tech roll."
3112 = "Tech rolls are slower than a tech in place, but it can create distance between you and your opponent."
3113 = "When trying to tech, you cannot just mash the dodge button. You must time the button press within 20 frames of hitting the ground."
3114 = "Immediately after those 20 frames, there is a 20 frame period where you cannot input another tech attempt."
3115 = "Okay, time to try it out. Tech my attacks 3 times in a row.\nJump near me when you're ready."
3116 = "You can also tech on walls the same way you tech on the ground."
3117 = "Let's try combining DI and teching for the final lesson."
3118 = "DI my attack so that you hit the wall, then tech it so you don't bounce off."
3119 = "Excellent!"
3120 = "Now that you understand DI and teching, your opponent will have to try much harder to defeat you."
3121 = "These techniques take practice though, so keep training until you've mastered them."

//---- INTERMEDIATE OFFENSE TUTORIAL
3122 = "Welcome to the intermediate offense tutorial! Here you will learn how to apply your attacks in different ways."
3123 = "First, let's learn more about how attacks work in general."
3124 = "Each attack consists of one or more hitboxes. An opponent gets hit by an attack if they touch one of its hitboxes."
3125 = "Hitboxes are normally invisible, but if you go into training mode, you can view the hitboxes for any attack."
3126 = "Some moves have tiny hitboxes called 'sweet spots'. Sweet spots are usually very small and very powerful."
3127 = "Sweet spots are usually found inside larger, weaker hitboxes (sour spots). If both hitboxes hit the enemy, the sweet spot usually takes priority over the sour spot."
3128 = "Here are some examples of sweet spots and sour spots. Notice how much larger the sour spot is."
3129 = "Zetterburn has sweet spots on his FAIR and UAIR, which are excellent kill moves."
3130 = "Try hitting me 3 times with the sweet spot of either FAIR or UAIR."
3131 = "Now let's learn how to combo moves together."
3132 = "Comboing is the concept of stringing moves together without giving your opponent time to escape."
3133 = "Because of directional influence, most combos are not guaranteed. In order to continue comboing your opponent, you must react to which direction they go."
3134 = "Let's test it out. Start a combo on me with the first hit of UTILT, then I'll mix up my DI to either stay close to you or go far away."
3135 = "When I stay close, hit me with an aerial. When I go far, hit me with a dash attack."
3136 = "Combo me 3 times in a row. I'll alternate between DIing in and out every time you start a combo."
3137 = "Many times, you will have to predict your opponent's DI to be able to continue a combo. Certain situations call for certain types of combos, and understanding this comes with practice and experience."
3138 = "Now let's try edgeguarding."
3139 = "Edgeguarding is a powerful technique that prevents your opponents from recovering after being knocked off the stage."
3140 = "There are two main methods for edgeguarding:\n -Staying on stage: safer but easier for the opponent to avoid.\n -Going offstage: riskier but harder for the opponent to avoid."
3141 = "Powerful attacks that send downward or horizontally are generally very good edgeguard moves, since most opponents have fewer options when recovering low."
3142 = "Keep in mind that your opponent may use wall jumping for recovery as well, so sending the opponent far away from a wall also limits their options considerably."
3143 = "Let's try it out. Successfully edgeguard this Zetterburn 3 times. Make sure his feet never touch the ground."
3144 = "Good! The next lesson will cover how to effectively deal with parries."
3145 = "As you know, if an opponent parries your attack, you will be stunned. The exception to this rule is the jab combo, excluding the final hit."
3146 = "If an opponent parries one of the first two hits of your jab combo, they will still gain invincibility but you will not be stunned. This makes jab a safe way to apply pressure to opponents who parry often."
3147 = "Test it out by jabbing me, then running away from my counterattack after I parry you. Make sure not to do the 3rd hit of jab."
3148 = "Let's bring tilts into the equation."
3149 = "After jabbing, you can attack with a tilt instead of continuing the jab combo."
3150 = "This allows you to hit confirm your jabs into different tilts so you can mix up your combo starters."
3151 = "Try hitting me with a jab and cancelling it into a tilt 3 times."
3152 = "Excellent!"
3153 = "Most of the concepts in this tutorial take a lot of practice to perfect, but it is necessary to master them in order to defeat tougher opponents. Keep training!"

//---- ADVANCED MOVEMENT TUTORIAL
3154 = "Welcome to the advanced movement tutorial! While the execution of these moves is fairly easy, applying them to your gameplay takes practice and strategy."
3155 = "Let's start with dash dancing."
3156 = "When you first input a dash, you enter a state called 'initial dash'.\nThis state lasts for a short time, then transitions into the 'run' state."
3157 = "If you try to turn around during the 'run' state, you'll have to go through a turnaround animation which slows your movement down."
3158 = "However, if you try to turn around during the 'initial dash' state, you will instantly dash in the other direction. This is called a dash dance."
3159 = "Dash dancing is very useful when trying to weave in and out of an opponent's attack range. It also helps to keep your movement unpredictable."
3160 = "Try to dash underneath me, then dash dance away before I can hit you. (Start your dash relatively close to me, so you don't enter the 'run' state. If you enter the turnaround animation under me, your score will be reset.)"
3161 = "Repeated use of dash dancing is extremely effective at confusing enemies as long as you keep the timing unpredictable."
3162 = "Another technique that can keep your movement unpredictable is the wavedash."
3163 = "Wavedashing is performed by air dodging into the ground immediately after jumping. When landing during an air dodge, you keep the momentum from the air dodge."
3164 = "If you angle your airdodge horizontally, you will quickly move sideways.\nIf you angle your airdodge straight downward, you will do a wavedash in place."
3165 = "If you input the air dodge while in jumpsquat, you can wavedash without leaving the ground. This is called buffering a wavedash."
3166 = "Buffering a wavedash while holding the control stick completely horizontal will give you the maximum distance on your wavedash."
3167 = "Let's try it out. Keep wavedashing until you're over here.\n(Note: I've disabled all movement options except the buffered wavedash, so you'll need to do the inputs pretty quickly.)"
3168 = "Like dash dancing, wavedashing is also useful for baiting out enemy attacks."
3169 = "Next up is wavelanding."
3170 = "Wavelanding is when you air dodge into the ground while in the air.\nIt is frequently used to quickly land on platforms."
3171 = "Wavelanding horizontally is also a great way to cover a long distance very quickly."
3172 = "To try out wavelanding, jump through the platform and air dodge onto it once you're above it. Repeat this 3 times."
3173 = "Excellent!"
3174 = "Be sure to practice these movement techniques frequently, as they are vital to having an intimidating offense and a tricky defense."
3175 = "Even though you know how to execute these moves, you will still need to discover when to use them to get the most out of them. This comes with experience."

//---- ADVANCED DEFENSE TUTORIAL
3176 = "Welcome to the advanced defense tutorial! The techniques presented in this lesson are fairly situational but incredibly useful."
3177 = "First, we'll learn how to survive when you're spiked downward offstage."
3178 = "All you need is a combination of good DI and a wall tech."
3179 = "DI my attack toward the wall, then tech as soon as you hit the wall."
3180 = "Nice!"
3181 = "Now let's learn how to survive strong attacks at the ledge."
3182 = "Right when you're hit with an attack, you will stop in place for a few frames.\nThis is called hitpause."
3183 = "While you are in hitpause near a wall, you can input a wall tech regardless of the direction the attack sends you."
3184 = "Try using a diagonal uspecial to ride up this wall. When you get close to me while using uspecial, I will attack you."
3185 = "Tech my attack 3 times in a row. Make sure you are touching the wall when you get hit, or else you won't be able to tech against it."
3186 = "While this technique is useful for all characters, it is absolutely vital to Zetterburn's recovery."
3187 = "The next lesson is all about SDI, which stands for Shift Directional Influence. It is used to escape from multi-hit moves."
3188 = "Holding the left or right stick in a direction right when you are hit by a move will move your character a short distance." //***updated
3189 = "You can only shift once per hit, so the effect is minimal on single-hit moves. The right stick takes priority over the left stick if both are held." //***updated
3190 = "Try to escape my attack before the final hit by holding the control stick away from me every time you get hit." //***updated
3191 = "Great!"
3192 = "Now for the final lesson in defense: Drift DI."
3193 = "After being hit by a move, you can drift left or right while flying through the air. This is separate from DI, as it occurs after you are launched."
3194 = "For instance, you can drift inward after a strong hit to avoid flying too far. You can also drift outward while being comboed to put more space between you and your opponent."
3195 = "A combination of inward DI followed by outward Drift DI can help you escape from seemingly guaranteed combos."
3196 = "DI my hit inward, then drift away to avoid my next attack."
3197 = "Incredible!"
3198 = "Proper use of these techniques will serve you well when trying to foil the opponent's plans, so be sure to practice them until they're second nature."

//---- ADVANCED OFFENSE TUTORIAL
3199 = "Welcome to the advanced offense tutorial! Here, you will learn how to use timing and quick inputs to give you more options for attacking your opponents."
3200 = "First, let's learn to autocancel multi-hit aerials."
3201 = "While doing a multi-hit aerial, try landing before the final hit comes out. This way, the enemy will not be sent very far and you'll be able to combo them easily afterward."
3202 = "It is much easier to autocancel an aerial if you fastfall, since there will be less time for the final hit to come out."
3203 = "Try hitting me with a autocancelled NAIR followed by an UTILT 3 times.\nBe sure to start your NAIR right before you land so that the final hit never comes out. Fastfalling will also help cancel the final hit."
3204 = "Some characters benefit from autocancelled aerials more than others, so try it out with all of them."
3205 = "The next technique will allow you to jump toward an enemy while facing backward. This allows you to use BAIRs to approach your enemies."
3206 = "This is called a Reverse Aerial Rush, or RAR for short."
3207 = "To perform a RAR, all you have to do is jump while in the 'run turnaround' state."
3208 = "In the 'run turnaround' state, you will lose forward momentum gradually. So the earlier you input the jump, the faster your RAR will travel."
3209 = "Remember, you cannot enter the 'run turnaround' state from the 'initial dash' state, so make sure you've run far enough to enter the 'run' state before pressing backward."
3210 = "As soon as you leave the ground, you'll want to start holding foward again so you can maintain foward momentum."
3211 = "So the inputs are:\nRun -> Press backward + Jump -> Hold forward -> Aerial\nThe middle 3 inputs should be done as fast as possible."
3212 = "Try hitting me with 3 RAR BAIRs while I'm offstage.\nYou can check the text at the bottom to see if you're doing the RAR correctly."
3213 = "Good!"
3214 = "The next technique is called the Special Reverse."
3215 = "When inputting a special attack, you can reverse its direction by pressing the opposite direction immediately afterward."
3216 = "To test this out, try reversing a DSPECIAL to hit me."
3217 = "Nice!"
3218 = "For the next lesson, you'll learn how to beat parries.\nAll it takes is a bit of patience."
3219 = "If your opponent is parrying a lot of your approaches, it means you're starting to become predictable."
3220 = "If this happens, you can trick your opponent into thinking that you're going to attack them by delaying your attacks a little bit."
3221 = "This will cause them to miss their parry and you will get to punish them."
3222 = "You can also achieve this by purposefully missing them with your attacks."
3223 = "Let's test it out! As soon as you come near me, I'll try to parry.\nDelay your attack and punish me for missing the parry."
3224 = "Fantastic!"
3225 = "If your opponent starts catching on to your delayed attacks, you can start mixing it up by alternating between early and later attacks."
3226 = "If you really want to optimize your punish game, you will need to incorporate hitfalling."
3227 = "When you hit an opponent with a melee attack, there will be a few frames of hitpause where both characters are frozen."
3228 = "If you buffer a fastfall during hitpause, you will cancel your previous momentum and fastfall instead. This is called hitfalling, and is the fastest way to reach the ground after hitting someone."
3229 = "When you perform a rising aerial, hitfalling allows you to cancel the endlag of your attack and continue your combo."
3230 = "Try hitting me with rising UAIR then hitfalling." //***updated
3231 = "Perfect!"
3232 = "Refine these techniques and you'll have no trouble keeping your opponents on their toes."

//---- ZETTERBURN TUTORIAL

3236 = "Try igniting me with each of these attacks."
3237 = "When your opponents are burning, they will take damage over time. But that's not all that your fire can do."
3238 = "If you land a strong attack on a burning opponent, your blow will be greatly amplified."
3239 = "Try igniting me then using a strong attack while I'm burning."
3240 = "Zetterburn's main weakness is his recovery."
3241 = "While Zetterburn is starting his USPECIAL, he is vulnerable for a long duration."
3242 = "If you have not used your air dodge already, you can use it to cancel the USPECIAL before it starts traveling. This is extremely useful for avoiding enemy attacks while offstage."
3243 = "Try cancelling your USPECIAL with an airdodge 3 times."
3244 = "Nice!"
3245 = "When Zetterburn hits an opponent with a dash attack, he can instantly cancel it into an USTRONG."
3246 = "This is called a gatling combo. While the USTRONG can usually be avoided with proper DI, it is still an extremely strong tool."
3247 = "To do a gatling combo, input an USTRONG during the hitpause of the dash attack."
3248 = "Try hitting me with 3 gatling combos in a row."
3249 = "Great!"
3250 = "Not only is Zetterburn's NSPECIAL the fastest move in the game, it can also be jump-cancelled."
3251 = "If you jump while in the recovery frames of NSPECIAL, it will cancel all of the endlag and allow you to act instantly."
3252 = "Try jumping out of NSPECIAL 3 times."

//---- ORCANE TUTORIAL
3255 = "Welcome to the Orcane tutorial!"
3256 = "Orcane, the Puddle Jumper, is one of the more complex rivals with a strong emphasis on zoning opponents out. Succeeding with Orcane requires a lot of planning."
3257 = "His playstyle revolves around placing puddles on the ground and using them to control space. NSPECIAL, DSPECIAL, and grounded USPECIAL all create puddles."
3258 = "Try making a puddle with each of these attacks. I'll clean up the puddles right after you make them."
3259 = "Having a puddle onstage is essential to recovering as Orcane."
3260 = "If a puddle is already on the stage, your USPECIAL will teleport you directly to the puddle, no matter how far away it is."
3261 = "Teleporting to a puddle also functions as an extremely strong attack. However, this attack has significant endlag, so it can be punished easily if the opponent is ready."
3262 = "Try using the aerial version of USPECIAL to teleport to a puddle 3 times."
3263 = "You can also use puddles to boost your strong attacks."
3264 = "Using a strong attack while standing on a puddle will extend its range significantly."

3267 = "When used on a puddle, Orcane's FSPECIAL receives a significant boost in kill power."
3268 = "But before that, let's learn a little more about how FSPECIAL works."
3269 = "Normally, when you use FSPECIAL in the air, you will go into special fall. If you hit an enemy with the attack, however, you will avoid special fall and instead remain fully actionable." //***updated
3270 = "You can also change the length of the attack by holding backward or forward after using it."
3271 = "So now let's try it out. Try hitting me 3 times with a puddle-boosted FSPECIAL, then recovering immediately afterward."
3272 = "Great!"
3273 = "One of Orcane's strongest zoning tools is his ability to create a wall of bubbles."
3274 = "Using DSPECIAL while a puddle already exists will make the puddle erupt into a large column of bubbles. These bubbles can be angled by holding left or right."
3275 = "Orcane's FAIR creates a horizontal flow of bubbles. These bubbles can be angled by holding up or down."
3276 = "Bubbles are great for trapping opponents in order to disrupt their attacks or even follow up with an attack of your own."
3277 = "Try hitting me with both types of bubbles."
3278 = "Orcane's FAIR has another interesting property."
3279 = "If he has the right amount of momentum when using it, his back side gains a hitbox. This is called 'Bubble Butt'."

3323 = "Try hitting me with 3 of each type of rock throw."
3324 = "Good!"
3325 = "Kragg is very heavy, meaning he takes less knockback than the average rival. In addition, using his FSPECIAL ensures that he takes almost no knockback at all."

3404 = "When trying to recover without a tether, Maypul can sometimes struggle."
3405 = "Using UAIR will give Maypul a small upward boost relative to her current speed. If you use UAIR right after jumping, Maypul will get a significant upward boost."
3406 = "Try using an instant UAIR to extend your jumps and hit me. To get maximum height, be sure to input the UAIR as fast as possible."

3430 = "Try hitting me 3 times with both versions of DSPECIAL."
3431 = "Right on!"

3604 = "Using DSPECIAL will cause all of your grass to attack. After the attack, the grass will go into a cooldown state where it won't give you any benefits."
3605 = "Try hitting me with DSPECIAL 3 times."
3606 = "Wonderful!"
3607 = "FSPECIAL causes Sylvanos to dash forward and bite enemies, ripping up all grass in the way. The attack will continue to dash forward as long as there is grass under him."
3608 = "Holding forward or backward will cause Sylvanos to dash faster or slower."
3609 = "After hitting an opponent, you can cancel FSPECIAL into any action. You can also cancel the move after hitting a flower for a short time."
3610 = "Try hitting me with FSPECIAL and then cancelling into an attack 3 times."
3611 = "Fantastic!"
3612 = "USPECIAL causes Sylvanos to dig into the ground and emerge anywhere within a large radius. Move sideways while underground to determine where Sylvanos emerges."
3613 = "If there is grass where Sylvanos emerges, he can perform a strong bite attack by holding SPECIAL."
3614 = "If you don't hold SPECIAL or if there is no grass where he emerges, he will emerge quicker but with no attack."
3615 = "Try hitting me with USPECIAL's bite 3 times."
3616 = "Awesome!"
3617 = "You can also cancel USPECIAL by pressing the dodge button while still in the air." //***updated

3619 = "Try cancelling USPECIAL 3 times."
3620 = "Very good!"
3621 = "Sylvanos' BAIR fires a strong vine attack that can be angled up or down."
3622 = "When the vine collides with the ground, it will hold Sylvanos in place, allowing him to perform any action. Performing another BAIR will cancel the attack."
3623 = "Try using downward-angled BAIR to grab the ground or the wall 3 times."
3624 = "Perfect!"
3625 = "This concludes the Sylvanos tutorial!"

//---- ELLIANA TUTORIAL
3626 = "Welcome to the Elliana tutorial!"
3627 = "Elliana uses her steam powered mech to fly around the battlefield and unleash an arsenal of various weapons."
3628 = "Elliana doesn't have a double jump and instead can hover around, even while attacking. Hovering builds up heat, however, and will overheat the mech if used too much."
3629 = "She cannot hover during the endlag of aerials or strong attacks, so she will lose some height when using them."
3630 = "Try hitting me with aerials 3 times. You'll have to hover to reach me."
3631 = "Great!"
3632 = "Another way to build up heat is to hold the ATTACK button when performing DASH ATTACK or FTILT."
3633 = "You can repeat these attacks infinitely until you overheat. Once you're overheated, you'll have to cool off before you can repeat them again."
3634 = "Try doing 3 fully extended DASH ATTACKS followed by 3 fully extended FTILTS."
3635 = "Good!"
3636 = "Using special attacks will also build up heat, so you can't use them too frequently."
3637 = "If you need to cool down, use a strong attack to expel steam from your mech. Steam will hit opponents who come near it, but can be pushed around by attacks."
3638 = "You can use strong attacks both in the air and on the ground, and all of them give you a momentum boost in the opposite direction they attack."
3639 = "Try hitting me 3 times with strong attack steam. Be careful not to overheat or your strong attacks will change."
3640 = "Excellent!"
3641 = "If Elliana is overheated when performing a strong attack, it will create an explosion instead of steam."
3642 = "While overheated, you won't be able to hover or use special moves, so be careful. Strong attacks release heat and can quickly return her to her normal state."
3643 = "Try overheating and hitting me with strong attack explosions 3 times."
3644 = "Nice!"
3645 = "Elliana's NSPECIAL allows her to fire a rocket fist in any direction. After traveling a short distance, the fist will explode."
3646 = "When she fires the rocket fist, the recoil will launch her in the opposite direction."
3647 = "Try hitting me with NSPECIAL's explosion 3 times. I will disable your jump so you have to aim upward."
3648 = "Great!"
3649 = "FSPECIAL fires a missile that can be controlled after firing. Use the control stick to aim the missile, but be careful not to lose track of your own movements."
3650 = "Try hitting me with FSPECIAL 3 times. Your jump is still disabled, so you'll have to aim from the ground."
3651 = "Fantastic!"
3652 = "You can also charge FSPECIAL to fire a large rocket instead. Charged Fspecial can still be controlled, but much less so."
3653 = "Try hitting me with charged FSPECIAL 3 times."
3654 = "Awesome!"
3655 = "Elliana's DSPECIAL drops a sticky bomb straight downward. When it lands on the ground, it stays there and can be detonated with FSPECIAL's missile."
3656 = "Upon detonation, DSPECIAL will explode 3 times, trapping enemies for a short duration."
3657 = "Try hitting DSPECIAL with FSPECIAL 3 times."
3658 = "Awesome!"
3659 = "DSPECIAL can also stick to opponents if dropped on top of them. After a short arming time, the bomb will detonate if the player is hit by FSPECIAL." //***updated
3660 = "Using DSPECIAL again will remove the bomb from the opponent and drop a new one."
3661 = "Try hitting me with FSPECIAL after sticking me with DSPECIAL 3 times."
3662 = "Perfect!"
3663 = "The quickest way to cool down after overheating is to use USPECIAL. This causes Elliana to abandon ship, leaving her mech behind to explode."
3664 = "This will instantly release all heat, but will put Elliana in a dangerous position, as she is very light and can only air dodge and wall jump when outside of her mech."
3665 = "You can adjust the height of USPECIAL by holding up or down. Once she reaches the ground, she will quickly rebuild her mech."
3666 = "Try using USPECIAL and then airdodging 3 times."
3667 = "Awesome!"
3668 = "This concludes the Elliana tutorial!"

//---- SHOVEL KNIGHT TUTORIAL
3669 = "Welcome to the Shovel Knight tutorial!"
3670 = "Shovel Knight steels his shovel and makes use of his wide array of items to engage his opponents."
3671 = "Many of his attacks aid him in moving around the stage, such as his UAIR: Rising Dagger."
3672 = "Holding down the attack button while performing UAIR will cause Shovel Knight to hold the dagger out for longer and rise into the air."
3673 = "Try performing 3 fully extended UAIRS."
3674 = "Nice!"
3675 = "Shovel Knight's USTRONG can throw a block of dirt when fully charged."
3676 = "You can hold left or right to change the launch angle of the dirt block. Only one block can exist at a time, so you must destroy it before making another one."
3677 = "Hitting the dirt block with USTRONG or DTILT will launch it without breaking it."
3678 = "Try hitting me with 3 dirt blocks spawned from a fully charged USTRONG."
3679 = "Good!"
3680 = "You may have noticed gems emerging from the dirt blocks when you break them. Gems also spawn any time you hit an opponent."
3681 = "Shovel Knight can collect these gems to gain currency, which can be used to buy items and armor."
3682 = "Gems will disappear after a short duration, so you must be quick to collect them. Shovel Knight's NSPECIAL allows him to collect gems from a distance."
3683 = "Try hitting me to spawn gems, then using NSPECIAL to collect them."
3684 = "Perfect!"
3685 = "Now that you have some gems to spend, why not open up the shop menu?\nYou can buy new relics to replace your NSPECIAL."
3686 = "To start shopping, just press the TAUNT button. Use LEFT and RIGHT to scroll through the shop and press ATTACK to purchase an item.\n(In this tutorial only, you have unlimited gems.)"
3687 = "One of the relics you can buy is the WAR HORN. It lets out a powerful blast of sound that sends enemies directly away from you. The outer edge of the attack is stronger than the center."
3688 = "Try purchasing the WAR HORN and using NSPECIAL to hit me 3 times."
3689 = "Great!"
3690 = "Another item you can purchase is the GHOST GLOVE. This lets you fire quick, short-ranged projectiles."
3691 = "If you land after shooting the GHOST GLOVE all endlag will be cancelled, allowing you to follow up with another attack."
3692 = "Try hitting me with the GHOST GLOVE 3 times."
3693 = "Fantastic!"
3694 = "The third and final purchasable relic is the MOBILE GEAR. Once thrown, the MOBILE GEAR will deploy, becoming a moving platform that hits opponents and jumps when reaching the end of a platform."
3695 = "Hold a direction to change the angle you throw the MOBILE GEAR. Throwing it higher gives you more time to get on before it starts moving, while throwing it lower can make it avoid platforms."
3696 = "Try hitting me with a JAB while riding on the mobile gear."
3697 = "Marvelous!"
3698 = "You can also buy armor from the shop. The cheapest armor is the DYNAMO MAIL."
3699 = "The DYNAMO MAIL allows Shovel Knight to perform aerial strong attacks after landing a hit with his DAIR: Shovel Drop."
3700 = "Try hitting me with an aerial strong attack 3 times."
3701 = "Awesome!"
3702 = "The other armors are the MAIL OF MOMENTUM and the ORNATE PLATE."
3703 = "The MAIL OF MOMENTUM makes Shovel Knight significantly heavier, but also makes it harder to stop when moving. This allows for sliding attacks and long wavedashes."
3704 = "The ORNATE PLATE makes you sparkle gold... and that's it. I'm not sure why you would ever buy it, actually."
3705 = "Another way to collect gems is to use DSPECIAL: the Fishing Rod."
3706 = "Cast your line into the bottom blastzone and press SPECIAL once '!!' appears over Shovel Knight's head. He will reel in a treasure rock that releases gems when hit."
3707 = "Try fishing up 3 treasure rocks and collecting all of their gems."
3708 = "Terrific!\nIf you time your reel in perfectly, you may fish up something special..."
3709 = "Shovel Knight's FSPECIAL is the PROPELLER DAGGER. This move shoots Shovel Knight forward, bouncing off of anything that he hits."
3710 = "Holding down the SPECIAL button will charge the move, making it travel farther and hit harder."
3711 = "At full charge, Shovel Knight will use the INFINIDAGGER and travel an infinite distance. This move will bounce off of blastzones, so don't worry about flying off the side of the screen."
3712 = "While traveling on the ground, Shovel Knight can cancel the move by jumping, but only before it hits."
3713 = "The cancel is not instant, however, so you have to commit to the forward momentum. Holding backward when jump-cancelling will cause Shovel Knight to turn around when he jumps."
3714 = "Try jump-cancelling FSPECIAL and then hitting me with NAIR 3 times."
3715 = "Sweet!"
3716 = "This concludes the Shovel Knight tutorial!"

//---- EXTRA TUTORIAL
3721 = "If you want your stocks to last longer, try winning neutral a little more."

3724 = "If you keep getting punished for rushing in, try learning how to form a gameplan."
3725 = "To learn how to play your character, try completing their tutorial."
3726 = "Try out different characters and you might find one that works for you."
3727 = "Practice your movement to stop getting hit by all of your opponent's attacks."
